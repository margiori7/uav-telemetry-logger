# uav-telemetry-logger
This project implements a UAV telemetry logging system that connects to a flight simulator via MAVLink, captures key flight parameters in real time, stores them in CSV format, and enables data replay with visual plots. It demonstrates applied skills in networking, data acquisition, and flight systems analysis.
